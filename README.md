**Status:** In Progress / Completed  
**Year:** 2025–2026  

## Overview
This repository documents my completion of Harvard University's CS50x course.
I completed all problem sets and built a final project focused on applying
computer science fundamentals to real-world problems.

## Topics Covered
- C programming
- Memory management
- Algorithms and data structures
- Python
- SQL
- Web development
- Problem solving and computational thinking

## Motivation
I am interested in computer science and cybersecurity. I began CS50x
to strengthen my foundations in low-level programming and algorithms
before advanced coursework and competitions.

## Final Project
See `/final_project` for full documentation.
